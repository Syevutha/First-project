    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p> I am an industrial chemistry student with a passion for graphic design and software development.</p>

<p><b>Introduction:</b><br>
Having recently completed my degree in Industrial Chemistry, 
I've developed a strong foundation in chemical principles, laboratory techniques, and analytical problem-solving.
Now, I'm excited to embark on a new journey into the world of software development.</p>

<p><b>Passion for learning: </b><br>
I've always been passionate about exploring new horizons and pushing the boundaries of my knowledge. 
While my academic background lies in chemistry, I've discovered a deep fascination for the intricacies of coding and software engineering.</p>

<p><b>Current Endeavors:</b><br>
Currently, I'm immersing myself in the world of software development, learning languages like Python.
I'm enthusiastic about delving into topics such as web development
and I'm eager to apply my problem-solving skills to new technological frontiers.</p>

<p><b>Career Aspirations:</b><br>
My ultimate goal is to integrate my expertise in industrial chemistry with my newfound skills in software development. 
I envision myself contributing to innovative projects that bridge the gap between science and technology, whether it's developing software solutions for chemical processes
or leveraging data analytics to optimize industrial operations.</p>

<p><b>Hobbies:</b> <br>
Beyond academics and coding, I enjoy hiking in nature, graphics design , and immersing myself in literature and music.
